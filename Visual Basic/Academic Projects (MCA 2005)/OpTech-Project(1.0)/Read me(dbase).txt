	Database Related Problems, their solutions (during running of OpTech)
	---------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Don't try to delete the folder named "sdbase" and the contents 
	   reside in it, especially the database file "dbOptech".Any attempt
	   to move or delete these objects from thier absolute place will cause
	   malfunctioning of "OpTech". Never try to modify the design and data-
	   records of the database file "dbOpTech", if you does "OpTech" will 
           not work properly.
                 
                 If you already lost these objects, then run "OpTech" any way.
           Choose the option to make use of the "Default database". This will allow 	 	   you to build/create a "new database" for "OpTech".It then restores
	   all the objects that you lost. But all the previously stored problems
	   will be lost.

		If you don't have "Microsoft Access" then creation of "new database"
	   will not work and in that case installing "MS-Access" first and then
           rerunning "OpTech" may resolve the problem.

		An easy way can be chosen if you alredy owns a database of "MS-Access"
	   or "Oracle".Run "OpTech", Choose "No" for the option to select the "Default 	   
	   Database", during the running of "OpTech" and specify the database details 		   in the form provided. This database will be used by "OpTech" for after 	           
	   runnings.		    
		  
		If you are frequently obtaining errors from database, then delete
	   the database that causing problems, and then rerun "OpTech". Now either 		   select option for creating new database or select another existing 	   database.
