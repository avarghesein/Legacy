\par \tab      
\par 
\par   PROBLEMS UNDER Windows XP
\par   -------------------------
\par 
\par         When you are using Windows XP,You need Oracle 
\par         products installed with Version 9I or greater.The 8I or 
\par \tab  Preceeding Versions Will not  supported by XP.

\par   PROBLEMS UNDER Windows 95/98
\par   ----------------------------
\par 
\par         When you are using Windows 95/98,You need Oracle 
\par         Products installed with Version 8I or Lower.The 9I or 
\par         Succeeding Versions Will not  supported by 95/98.
\par \tab\tab          
\par \tab  
\par         MicroSoft JET ODBC Driver 4.0 will work with all these Operating
\par         Systems.But we will not recommend this driver since it will Not
\par \tab  Support all the features provided by the Software.
\par                              
\par   DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
\par   --------------------- 
\par 
\par         You  need a DataBase for the Project Scheduler Software.
\par         It may be either a MicroSoft Jet 4.0 DataBase(MicroSoft Access 
\par         97/2000/2002 file formats) or a Database provided by Oracle.
\par 
\par         
\par         WE STRICTLY RECOMMEND TO USE MICROSOFT OLEDB PROVIDER FOR ORACLE SINCE
\par         MICRODOFT ACCESS WILL NOT SUPPORT ALL THE FEATURES PROVIDED BY THIS 
\par         SOFTWARE.SO IF YOU ARE USING WINDOWS 95/98/2000 USE ORACLE PRODUCTS
\par         WITH VERSION 8I.FOR WINDOWS XP USE 9I OR HIGHER VERSIONS.
\par 
\par         The database is used by the PScheduler for maintaining,
\par         Scheduling details for later processing and for Security Purposes.
\par 
\par         During the very first use of the Software or After Removing
\par         Windows Registry contents during the use of the software,
\par         You can set database connection for the PScheduler.
\par 
\par         PSchedule creates & uses certain tables.So your data base
\par         Must be blank(with no tables) or not containing the tables 
\par         Listed below.Otherwise the PScheduler will behave abnormally.
\par         It  will  create errors and the calculations are         
\par         More error prone .It may cause Destruction of DATA in 
\par         Your data base.

\par   2.HOW TO USE THE SCHEDULER
\par   *************************
\par          
\par         PRE-REQUEST
\par         -----------
\par 
\par                     YOU MUST BE FAMILIAR WITH PROJECT EVALUATION & REVIEW TECHNIQUE (PERT),   
\par         CRITICAL PATH METHOD(CPM).YOU MUST HAVE A THROUGH KNOWLEDGE IN PROJECT SCHEDULING &   
\par         RELATED PROJECT NETWORKING CONCEPTS.IF YOU ARE NOT AQUAINTED WITH THESE REFER
\par         THESE TECHNIQUES BEFORE USING THE SOFTWARE,SINCE IMMENSE CALCULATIONS DONE BY
\par         THE PSCHEDULER IS BASED ON THESE CONCEPTS.         
\par 
\par                 
\par                      PScheduler is controlled exclusiveley by Administrator Group.
\par          For the first time Admin group can be created by the name & password 
\par          provided by the software.The admins have the choice to add new admins &
\par          change their passwords.
\par 
\par                      Beside the admin group,it also create & maintains a Personnel
\par          database.So that Project & Task Managers are selected from this database.So
\par          this software is fully meant for an entreprize or a Group. 
\par  
\par                      Admin have the right to add/edit/update the personnel information.
\par           
\par          CREATE A NEW PROJECT SCHEDULE
\par          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\par 
\par                       Select new-schedule from the ProjectSchedule menu in the Admin 
\par          Options form.Fill the first form that appears,The details of the project. 
\par 
\par                       Now fill the next form.Give datails of Subtasks that constitutes
\par          your project.
\par                       After set the relationship among the tasks,in the order in which 
\par          they will be carried out.  
\par                       Finally choose close to complete the Scheduling.
\par          The projectmanger is provided by a unique password to access his project & the
\par          Register in which the persons holding the subtasks of the specified project makes  
\par          entries.
\par  
\par          
\par          UPDATE A SCHEDULE
\par          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\par 
\par                         A project manger can update his project.Admin can update any
\par         project.Updating means entering the actual starting & ending status of a project.
\par                         
\par                         Admin can change the Mangers of projects or subtasks,so that
\par         the projects/tasks can be assigned to efficient managers.Also he can change the
\par         duration of the task or starting date of the project if it is not already started.
\par 
\par                         He can add a new subtask to a incompleted exsisting or active
\par         project.For that there is forms for entering new task & setting its relation
\par         with other tasks.
\par          
\par                         For all the activities described above,Scheduler provides provisions.
\par         
\par         Also admin can delete a schedule or recall a deleted schedule.
\par 
\par         
\par         ANALYSING A PROJECT
\par         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\par                           
\par                            There is two kind of analysis.
\par 
\par                  I.Personnel Analysis                                  
\par                  II.Project/task Analysis.
\par 
\par         
\par                  Personnel analysis means evaluating the working range of persons
\par         in projects & subtasks.For this a special register is provided.Each task manager
\par         can make an entry in the register for the task assigned to him for each day
\par         he appears for work for the mentioned task.Also a person can work for several
\par         tasks of the same project or differant projects.
\par                  A person can enter to register with a previlage to access the registry
\par         contents of the tasks assigned to him.
\par                  A project manager have full access to the register in the sense that
\par         he can access the Task Manger's register contents who worked under the project
\par         manager.In other words he can access all registry contents of subtasks under
\par         his project.
\par                  A admin have a full access to all tasks in all projects in the register.
\par 
\par                  There provided a REPORT for the administrator to view the persons
\par        worked under a project/ worked under a task.Their(person's) status with respect
\par        to the project/task.This report gives the persons worked for a project during an
\par        interval.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par                   Project/Task analysis means analysing the project with it's preassumed
\par        standards.The comparison is taken between the preassumed standards & the real 
\par        progress of task/project.It says whether the task/project started properly with in
\par        the time interval specified,if not it's affect on the whole project and it's 
\par        successortasks.We can also have look into the affect of predecessortask on a task.
\par        The project's Progress can be clearly found out.The delay in the project or the
\par        Minimum delay in the project can be predicted.
\par 
\par                   All the calculation are based on PERT(Project Evaluaton Technique).
\par        The tools used to evaluate a project are,
\par 
\par                   PERT.
\par                   EARLY START.
\par                   LATE  START.
\par                   REAL  START.
\par                   CRITICAL PATH METHOD(CPM).
\par 
\par        For Visual or graphical Analysis of The project There are some tools Provided.
\par 
\par                   GANTT CHARTS    
\par                   -----------
\par                         EARLY START GANTT CHART.
\par                         LATE  START GANTT CHART.
\par                         REAL  START GANTT CHART.
\par   
\par        Also there provided a  MAIN PROJECT REPORT that tells the current status of the
\par        project with respect to the assumed standards.Also there provided different 
\par        REPORTS on the subtasks,their affect on successortasks,affect of predecessortasks.
\par        Also report provided for CRITICALPATH EVALUATION.
