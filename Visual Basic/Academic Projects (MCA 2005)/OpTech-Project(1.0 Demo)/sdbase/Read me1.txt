DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
	One of the main thing that you need to run this package is that you must own a DATABASE. Since all the problems are stored in the database, it is a necessary. You can use either ORACLE or MS-ACCESS databases for the same. 
	During the running of this software for first time, you must provide the details of the database for the software. This requires the following details.


* PROVIDER OF THE DATABASE.
* USER NAME OF THE DATABASE.
* PASSWORD (if any).
* THE DATA SOURCE.

Problems related to the Operating system


Some problems that are likely to happen are :


*	If you are using Windows-XP or Windows-2000 or other operating systems with NT technology you need ORACLE-9I or higher products. ORACLE-8I products will not work on these environments.

*	If you are using Windows98 or lower versions you need ORACLE-8I products, since ORACLE-9I will not work on such environments.

*	MS-ACCESS will work on all the above mentioned environments but the FILE-FORMAT of the database has a major impact on the software.

*	If you are using Windows of NT technology any FILE-FORMAT will work properly.

*	If you are using Windows98 or lower versions and the FILE_FORMAT is of 2000 or higher , certain sections of the software will not work ; for ex: BRANCH & BOUND METHOD. This may happen if you copy a MS-ACCESS database from an
	NT-environment to a Windows98 environment.
